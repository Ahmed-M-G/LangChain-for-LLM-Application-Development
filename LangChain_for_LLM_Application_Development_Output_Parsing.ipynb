        "LangChain prompt templates not only help structure input prompts but also facilitate the parsing of model outputs. By defining a predictable format for the output within the prompt, developers can more easily extract specific information or structure responses in a way that is machine-readable. This capability is especially useful in applications that require post-processing or further analysis of the language model's response.\n",
