## Overview

This repository accompanies the DeepLearning.AI short course, _LangChain for LLM Application Development_. You'll explore key LangChain features through hands-on Jupyter notebooks, covering:

- Prompting LLMs & parsing model outputs  
- Memory management techniques  
- Building and chaining LLM operations  
- Retrieval-aware question answering  
- Agent design and execution  

LangChain is a powerful framework for creating LLM-based apps‚Äîchatbots, Q&A tools, multi-step chains, and smart agents.

## Course Topics

- Models, Prompts & Parsers  
- Memory: buffering and summaries  
- Chains: linear, sequential, router  
- Question Answering over documents  
- Agent development and use-cases

## Usage & Examples

Each notebook includes code snippets and explanations:

- Prompting & Parsing: Interact with LLMs, format prompts, and structure outputs
- Memory: Maintain conversation context using buffer and summarization memory
- Chains: Compose multi-step logic and dynamically route tasks
- QnA: Embed documents and answer questions with retrieval-based methods
- Agents: Build autonomous agents using tools like search, calculator, etc.
